# Latin-sans-minimum-kerning-pairs
A text string to test fitting and kern Basic Latin

This is a work in progress and I might come back to update it at some point. It is a cleaned up version of a text string that I use to test fitting and kern fonts. It is best suited for sans designs (texts and display) but with alterations and depending on the design it can work with serifs as well. 

The Text file includes strings that try to produce the most common - and important - kerning pairs in context for the Basic Latin character set. Provided that you choose your kerning classes wisely it aspires to give you a small in lenght but quite comprehensive set of words and examples which will help you kern:

- Uppercase to Uppercase
- Uppercase to punctuation
- lowercase to lowercase
- lowercase to punctuation 
- lowercase to Uppercase to lowercase
- numerals to numerals (limited set)
- numerals to punctuation (limited set)
- numerals to letters (limited set)

There are assumptions for the design (i.e. bdpq are pressumed to belong to the same kerning class as o, however, it includes a and g in case the design features double story versions. In case your bdpq vary significantly from the o then you should use search/replace in the kern strings and just create the required ones.
